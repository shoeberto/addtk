ag-dev debugging toolkit (pronounced "attic")

check out INSTALL for installation and usage instructions.

functions:
+ agbreak     - halts execution and prints a stacktrace.
+ agbacktrace - prints a stacktrace
+ agvar       - pretty prints a variable with a label

hit me up if you have any comments on how to make this more useful. I am a formally trained c++ dev who is barely literate in php so this is probably hideous to any sensible web dev.
